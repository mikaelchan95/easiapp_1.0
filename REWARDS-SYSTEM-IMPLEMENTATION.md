# Rewards System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive business/corporate rewards system has been integrated into the flow application, following the Earn → Build → Redeem structure. The system is designed for B2B customers with higher spend volumes and includes points earning, tier progression, and reward redemption features.

## Components Created

### 1. RewardsContext (`app/context/RewardsContext.tsx`)
- Manages global rewards state including points, tiers, and history
- Handles earning points, redeeming rewards, and voucher management
- Tracks 12-month rolling spend for tier calculation

### 2. RewardsScreen (`app/components/Rewards/RewardsScreen.tsx`)
- Main rewards dashboard with tier status, points balance, and progress tracking
- Displays tier benefits and 12-month spend progress
- Catalog of redeemable rewards with filtering by category
- Points history modal showing all transactions

### 3. VoucherSection (`app/components/Checkout/VoucherSection.tsx`)
- Integrates voucher redemption into checkout flow
- Shows available vouchers with minimum order requirements
- Allows applying/removing vouchers during checkout

### 4. PointsEarnedToast (`app/components/UI/PointsEarnedToast.tsx`)
- Animated toast notification for showing points earned after orders
- Displays tier status and celebratory animations

## Rewards Structure

### Earning Points
- **Base Rate**: 1 SGD spent = 1 point
- **Bonus Triggers**:
  - First corporate order: +10,000 pts
  - Quarterly volume milestones (>S$50,000): +25,000 pts
  - Annual renewal of payment terms: +15,000 pts

### Tier System (12-month rolling)
- **Bronze**: S$0–50,000 spend
  - Access to weekly flash-deal alerts
- **Silver**: S$50,001–200,000 spend
  - 2% off all orders
  - Early-bird slots on same-day delivery
  - All Bronze benefits
- **Gold**: S$200,001+ spend
  - 5% off all orders
  - Free same-day delivery
  - Exclusive volume bundles (e.g., Buy 120 get 12 free)
  - All Silver benefits

### Redeemable Rewards
- **Voucher Blocks**: 
  - 20,000 pts = S$500 off
  - 50,000 pts = S$1,500 off
- **Volume Bundles**: 100,000 pts = "Buy 120 get 12 free" deal
- **Corporate Swag**: 30,000 pts = Premium bar tool set

## Design System Integration

The rewards system follows the established design guidelines:
- **White surfaces** (`--color-bg-base`) on light gray frame (`--color-bg-frame`)
- **Black primary elements** with white text for maximum contrast
- **Consistent spacing** using the 8px grid system
- **Shadow hierarchy** for depth and visual separation

## User Experience Features

### Visual Elements
- **Tier Badge**: Color-coded badges (Bronze/Silver/Gold) with trophy icon
- **Progress Bar**: Animated progress showing spend towards next tier
- **Points History**: Detailed transaction log with earned/redeemed points
- **Category Filters**: Easy navigation through reward types

### Animations
- **Progress Bar**: Smooth animation when tier progress updates
- **Toast Notifications**: Spring animations for points earned feedback
- **Modal Transitions**: Slide animations for voucher selection

### Integration Points
1. **Bottom Navigation**: Added Rewards tab with trophy icon
2. **Checkout Flow**: Voucher redemption before payment
3. **Order Success**: Points earned notification
4. **Profile Section**: Quick access from activities menu

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React Context for global rewards state
- Reducer pattern for predictable state updates
- Persistent voucher tracking with expiry dates

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript implementation
- Defined interfaces for all reward entities
- Type-safe navigation integration

### Performance
- Memoized calculations for tier progress
- Lazy loading of rewards catalog
- Optimized re-renders with useCallback

## Future Enhancements

1. **Push Notifications**: Alert users about expiring vouchers or new rewards
2. **Referral System**: Earn points by referring other businesses
3. **Seasonal Campaigns**: Limited-time bonus point events
4. **Partner Rewards**: Cross-brand redemption options
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Spending insights and reward optimization
