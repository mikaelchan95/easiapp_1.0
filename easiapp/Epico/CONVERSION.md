   - Implemented stack and tab navigators
   - Created TypeScript types for navigation structure

3. **Components**
   - Converted web components to React Native components
   - Used React Native's built-in components like `View`, `Text`, `TouchableOpacity`, etc.
   - Added mobile-specific UX patterns (tab bar, stack navigation)

4. **Styling**
   - Replaced Tailwind with React Native's StyleSheet API
   - Implemented mobile-friendly styling with Flexbox
   - Created responsive layouts for different screen sizes

5. **Features Implemented**
   - Home screen with featured products
   - Products browse and search functionality

   - Shopping cart with quantity controls
   - User profile management
   - Rewards program with points tracking

## Running the App

To run the app:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npx expo start`
3. Use a simulator/emulator or scan the QR code with Expo Go app
