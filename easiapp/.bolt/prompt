color scheme to use black on white as the primary colors with green as the secondary accent color. 

For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

1. Prioritize Clear, Concise Copy
Use precise labels: Don’t make users “earn tokens” when they’re really “claiming voting rewards.”

Keep it short: Strip out unnecessary words—four-word buttons often become confusing.

Avoid repetition: If your heading already says “Rewards,” you don’t need “Last 10 votes” immediately underneath; white space aids comprehension.

2. Embrace Visual Simplicity
Favor clarity over flash: A simple, well-labeled chart beats a fancy gradient blur that no one can read.

Limit decorative effects: Unless you can pull off a slick neumorphic or skeuomorphic detail without clutter, opt for flat, purposeful graphics.

3. Apply a Balanced Color Palette (60-30-10 Rule)
60% neutral base (white, light gray)

30% complementary accents (dark gray, black)

10% primary/brand color (e.g. red)

Tip: Too much “loud” color overwhelms; too little makes your UI feel dull.

4. Simplify Typography
Max four font sizes (headings, subheadings, body, captions).

Max two font weights (e.g. regular + bold).

Special case: Reserve a monospace face for big numeric values to prevent truncation or collision.

5. Rhythm & Spacing with the 8-Point Grid
Always pick multiples of 4 or 8 for padding, margins, and gaps (e.g. 8, 16, 24 px).

Maintain consistency: Group related elements with shared spacing—no more random 11 px or 27 px jumps.

Prioritize How It Feels
Beyond functionality, focus on the first impression—aim for smooth, delightful, playful, or premium sensations rather than “just another” interface.

Use Micro-Interactions as Emotional Feedback
Add tiny animations (bounces, glows, sparkles) on success or error states so each interaction feels rewarding and alive.

Celebrate Small Wins
Surface modest, intentional success moments (e.g. streak animations, confetti bursts) to reinforce continued engagement without overwhelming the user.

Animate Progress and Momentum
Show progress with motion (e.g. streak counters, level-up transitions, filling bars) so users feel their actions build toward something meaningful.

Polish Onboarding and First Impressions
Invest in smooth transitions, rich visuals, and subtle motion during signup or first-use flows to immediately convey quality and trust.

Design “Trust Signals” Through Craft
Treat visual details, motion, and transitions as core features—each micro-animation signals reliability, especially in complex domains like finance or crypto.

Keep It Approachable
Use friendly visuals and warm, playful details to lighten heavy topics (e.g. security flows, financial dashboards), making users feel more comfortable.

Build for Everyday Users, Not Just Early Adopters
Craft flows that anticipate questions and guide users intuitively—don’t assume domain knowledge.

Optimize Performance for Feel
Ensure feedback (taps, swipes, loading states) is snappy—speed itself becomes part of the emotional experience.
