## Color Scheme Rule

- **Canvas & Cards:**  
  - `--color-bg-base: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)` (pure white)  
  - Use for all primary surfaces (cards, panels, containers).

- **Frame & Backdrop:**  
  - `--color-bg-frame: hsl(0, 0%, 98%)` (very light gray)  
  - Use as the appâ€™s outer background behind white surfaces.

- **Text:**  
  - `--color-text-primary: hsl(0, 0%, 0%)` (black)  
  - `--color-text-secondary: hsl(0, 0%, 30%)` (dark gray)

- **Interactive Elements:**  
  - `--color-button-bg: hsl(0, 0%, 0%)` (black)  
  - `--color-button-text: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)` (white)  
  - Hover / active states: 10% & 20% lightness grays, respectively.

- **Borders & Dividers:**  
  - `--color-border: hsl(0, 0%, 90%)` (subtle light gray)

- **Shadows:**  
  - Light: `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.04)`  
  - Medium: `0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`

> **Rule:** Always place white surfaces (`--color-bg-base`) on the very light gray frame (`--color-bg-frame`), with black text and buttons for maximum clarity and contrast. ```
