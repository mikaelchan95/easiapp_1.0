# Location Picker Testing Guide

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. Google Maps Configuration
- Added Google Maps API key configuration to `app.json` for both iOS and Android platforms
- Added expo-location plugin with proper permissions

### 2. Map Component Improvements
- Added `PROVIDER_GOOGLE` to ensure Google Maps is used
- Implemented error handling with fallback UI
- Added loading state while map initializes
- Made "My Location" button functional
- Added location permission handling

### 3. Crash Prevention
- Added comprehensive error handling in `handleConfirmLocation`
- Validated callback functions before execution
- Added user-friendly error messages
- Improved error logging for debugging

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Rebuild the App
After the configuration changes, you need to rebuild:

```bash
# Clean and reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# For iOS (if running on Mac)
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
npx expo run:ios

# For Android
npx expo run:android
```

### 2. Test the Location Picker

#### Test from Home Screen
1. Open the app
2. On the home screen, tap the "Deliver to" button in the header
3. The location picker modal should open
4. Test the following features:
   - Search for locations
   - Switch to map view
   - Select a location
   - Confirm the selection

#### Test the Demo Component
To test the location picker in isolation:

1. Add a temporary button in your app to navigate to the demo:
```typescript
navigation.navigate('LocationPickerDemo');
```

2. Or temporarily modify App.tsx to start with LocationPickerDemo as the initial route

## Test Scenarios

### ✅ Basic Flow Test
1. Open location picker
2. Search for "Marina Bay"
3. Select a location
4. Confirm selection
5. **Expected**: Location updates without crash

### ✅ Map View Test
1. Open location picker
2. Tap map icon
3. **Expected**: Map loads with delivery zones
4. Tap on map to drop pin
5. Confirm location

### ✅ Error Handling Test
1. Turn off location permissions
2. Try "Current Location"
3. **Expected**: Error message displayed

### ✅ Search Test
1. Search for various locations
2. Try postal codes (e.g., "018956")
3. **Expected**: Relevant results appear

## Troubleshooting

### Map Still Shows White Screen

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure the Google Maps API key is valid and has the necessary APIs enabled:
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Maps SDK for iOS
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API

2. **Platform Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # For iOS, ensure you've run:
   cd ios && pod install
   
   # For Android, check if google-services.json is needed
   ```

3. **Check Console Logs**: Look for specific error messages about API key or configuration

### Still Crashing on Selection

1. Check if `AppContext` is properly provided
2. Verify all required props are passed to LocationPicker
3. Check console for specific error messages

### Development Tips

1. **Use the Test Component**: The `LocationPickerTest` component provides detailed logging
2. **Enable Debug Mode**: Add console logs in critical functions
3. **Test on Real Device**: Some features (GPS, maps) work better on real devices

## Next Steps

1. **Production Setup**:
   - Restrict API key to your app's bundle ID
   - Set up proper error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
   - Add analytics to track usage

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement map clustering for many locations
   - Add caching for frequently searched locations
   - Optimize map rendering for lower-end devices

3. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Add saved addresses functionality
   - Implement address autocomplete
   - Add delivery time estimates

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] App rebuilt with new configuration
- [ ] Map displays correctly
- [ ] Location selection doesn't crash
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Current location works (with permissions)
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Selected location persists in app state

Once all items are checked, the location picker should be fully functional!
