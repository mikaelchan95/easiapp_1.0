# Uber-Style Location Selector Implementation

## Overview
We've implemented a comprehensive Uber-like location selection experience with smooth animations, gesture support, and modern UI/UX patterns.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Global Location State Management**
- Added location state to `AppContext` for app-wide location management
- Location persists across app sessions using AsyncStorage
- Selected location displays in the header throughout the app

### 2. **Interactive Header Component**
- Tappable location header with:
  - Smooth press animations (scale & overlay)
  - Haptic feedback on interaction
  - Rotating chevron arrow animation
  - Loading state indicator
  - Full accessibility support

### 3. **Full-Screen Location Picker Modal**
- Slides up from bottom with smooth animation
- Multiple location input methods:
  - Search by address/landmark
  - Postal code input (Singapore-specific)
  - Current GPS location
  - Recent locations with swipe-to-delete
  - Saved locations with custom nicknames
  - Interactive map with pin drop

### 4. **Advanced Features**
- **Address Details Form**: Add unit numbers, building names, delivery instructions
- **Smart Suggestions**: Popular locations and search-based recommendations
- **Location Validation**: Checks if delivery is available to selected area
- **Gesture Support**: Pull-to-refresh, swipe gestures, drag-to-dismiss
- **Map Integration**: Interactive map view with delivery zones

## Usage

### Opening the Location Picker
When users tap "Deliver to [Location]" in the header:
1. Modal slides up with current location displayed
2. Search field auto-focuses for immediate typing
3. Recent and saved locations shown below

### Selecting a Location
Users can:
1. **Search**: Type address, landmark, or postal code
2. **Use Current Location**: One-tap GPS location
3. **Select Recent**: Quick access to previous locations
4. **Choose Saved**: Pre-saved addresses with nicknames
5. **Drop Pin**: Use map to select exact location

### Location Persistence
- Selected location saves automatically
- Persists across app restarts
- Updates globally - visible in all screens

## Components Structure

```
LocationPickerModal (Main modal container)
├── LocationPicker (Core picker logic)
│   ├── LocationHeader (Tappable header)
│   └── LocationBottomSheet (Selection UI)
│       ├── LocationSearchField
│       ├── LocationSuggestionsList
│       ├── SavedLocations
│       ├── LocationMapView
│       └── LocationConfirmButton
└── LocationScreen (Enhanced selection flow)
    ├── PostalCodeInput
    ├── AddressDetailsForm
    └── LocationSelectionUI
```

## Implementation Details

### State Management
```typescript
// In AppContext
interface AppState {
  // ... other state
  selectedLocation: LocationSuggestion | null;
}

// Location update action
dispatch({ type: 'SET_SELECTED_LOCATION', payload: location });
```

### Header Integration
```typescript
// In any screen with MobileHeader
<MobileHeader 
  onAddressPress={() => setLocationPickerVisible(true)}
  currentAddress={{ name: state.selectedLocation?.title || 'Select Location' }}
/>
```

### Location Selection Handler
```typescript
const handleLocationSelect = (location: LocationSuggestion) => {
  // Update global state
  dispatch({ type: 'SET_SELECTED_LOCATION', payload: location });
  
  // Close modal
  setLocationPickerVisible(false);
};
```

## UI/UX Highlights

1. **Smooth Animations**
   - Spring physics for natural motion
   - Cross-fade transitions
   - Gesture-based interactions

2. **Haptic Feedback**
   - Light tap on header press
   - Medium feedback on selection
   - Success vibration on confirmation

3. **Accessibility**
   - VoiceOver/TalkBack support
   - Proper labels and hints
   - Keyboard navigation

4. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful fallbacks for GPS errors
   - Delivery zone validation
   - Network error recovery

## Future Enhancements

1. **Voice Input**: Speech-to-text for address entry
2. **Address Sharing**: Share locations with contacts
3. **Smart Predictions**: ML-based location suggestions
4. **Delivery Time**: Show estimated delivery times per location
5. **Multi-Address**: Support multiple delivery addresses in one order

## Testing

To test the location selector:
1. Tap "Deliver to Marina Bay" in the header
2. Try different selection methods
3. Verify location persists after app restart
4. Test with different location permissions
5. Check accessibility with screen readers
