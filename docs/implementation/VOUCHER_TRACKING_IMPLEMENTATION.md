export type VoucherStatus = 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'expired' | 'used';
export type PointsTransactionType = 'earned' | 'redeemed' | 'expired' | 'missing';

// Enhanced Interfaces
interface VoucherRedemption {
  id: string;
  rewardId: string;
  title: string;
  value: number;
  pointsUsed: number;
  status: VoucherStatus;
  redeemedDate: string;
  expiryDate: string;
  usedDate?: string;
  orderId?: string;
  confirmationCode?: string;
}

interface MissingPointsEntry {
  id: string;
  orderId: string;
  orderDate: string;
  expectedPoints: number;
  reason: string;
  status: 'reported' | 'investigating' | 'resolved' | 'rejected';
  reportedDate: string;
  resolvedDate?: string;
}

interface PointsExpiry {
  id: string;
  points: number;
  earnedDate: string;
  expiryDate: string;
  source: string;
}
```
