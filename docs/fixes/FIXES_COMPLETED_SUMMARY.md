## 🧮 **SINGAPORE GST IMPLEMENTATION**

### Price Structure (All prices SGD)
```
Example: Macallan 12 Year Old Double Cask

RETAIL CUSTOMER:
├── Base Price: $110.00
├── GST (9%): $9.90
└── TOTAL: $119.90

TRADE CUSTOMER:
├── Base Price: $95.00 (trade discount)
├── GST (9%): $8.55
└── TOTAL: $103.55
```

### Cart Breakdown
```
CART SUMMARY:
├── Subtotal: $205.00 (before GST)
├── GST (9%): $18.45
├── Delivery: $5.00 (free over $150)
└── TOTAL: $228.45
```

## 🔒 **STOCK VALIDATION SYSTEM**

### Real-Time Validation
- ✅ **Out of Stock**: Cannot add to cart, shows error
- ✅ **Low Stock**: Shows "Only X left" warning
- ✅ **In Stock**: Normal add to cart flow
- ✅ **Quantity Limits**: Cannot exceed available stock

### Stock Status Examples
| Product | Stock | Status Display |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Macallan 12 | 25 units | "In Stock" (green) |
| Louis XIII | 2 units | "Only 2 left" (orange) |
| Macallan 25 | 0 units | "Out of Stock" (red) |
