- **Total Retail Price:** $119.90
- **Base Trade Price:** $95.00
- **GST (9%):** $8.55
- **Total Trade Price:** $103.55

- **Test 1:** Add 1 to cart ✅ SUCCESS
- **Test 2:** Add 2 more to cart ❌ ERROR: "Only 2 items available"
- **Test 3:** Try to add when stock = 0 ❌ ERROR: "This item is currently out of stock"

### Test Product: Macallan 25 Year Old
- **Available Stock:** 0 units (Out of Stock)
- **Test 1:** Add 1 to cart ❌ ERROR: "This item is currently out of stock"

## 🚨 **ELIMINATED RACE CONDITIONS**

### Before Fix (ProductDetailScreen)
```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC: Complex animation with race conditions
let progress = 0;
const animateProgress = () => {
  progress += 0.05;
  // Multiple setTimeout calls could overlap
  if (progress < 1) {
    setTimeout(animateProgress, 50); // RACE CONDITION
  }
};
```

### After Fix (ProductDetailScreen)
```typescript
// CLEAN: Simple timeout with validation
setTimeout(() => {
  // Single operation, no race conditions
  dispatch({ type: 'ADD_TO_CART', payload: { product, quantity } });
}, 1000);
```
